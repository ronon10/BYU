CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
A: Store Inventory Manager with Sales Analysis

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
A: The program will help small businesses manage their inventory and analyze sales. 
    Many small stores struggle to monitor their inventory in real-time and identify high 
    or low-performing products. With this system, the user will be able to register sales, 
    monitor product stock levels, and generate reports that identify best-selling items, 
    low stock items, and predict restocking needs.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
A: Handling CSV files to store and read inventory and sales data.
    Using libraries to generate charts (data visualization).
    Best practices for organizing functions in a larger system.
    Writing and testing robust code that handles exceptions.

4. What Python modules will your program use?
A: CSV, matplotlib, datatime, pandas, functools

    (Some examples are: csv, datetime, functools, matplotlib, math,
    pandas, pytest, random, requests, and tkinter.)

5. List the names of functions you will need?
A: load_inventory(), register_sale(), update_inventory(), generate_sales_report(), analyze_sales(), predict_restocking()

    (Remember that the most reusable functions don't get user input and
    don't print results but instead have parameters and return a result.
    Functions that get user input and print results are important and do
    useful work but are not easily reusable.)

    (Remember also that it's hard to test functions that get user input
    and print results. It's easy to test functions that don't get user
    input and don't print results but instead have parameters and return
    a result. Therefore, you should write most of your program functions
    to have parameters and return a result.)

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.
A: test_load_inventory(), test_register_sale(), test_update_inventory(), test_generate_sales_report(), test_analyze_sales(), test_predict_restocking()

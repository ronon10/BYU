I see the blessings that I got every day through Jesus Christ. In the simplest things, from the beginning of the day until it ends, we can see the Savior's hand blessing us. Today I can also see how much the Savior blessed my parents' lives to be able to raise 5 young children. Only through the hand of the Savior were these things possible, nowadays raising 5 small children at the same time would certainly not be easy.

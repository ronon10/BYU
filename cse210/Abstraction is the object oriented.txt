Abstraction is the object-oriented concept that shows users only what is essential, users do not know how the code works, but what it does. The benefit is to reduce complexity for developers, with modularity making it easier to understand and helping to extend the code. In this week's activity program, abstraction is demonstrated in the design of the class, Journal, the end user interacts with the diary without worrying about how the information is being saved.
The best example is the 'SaveToFile' method, it is quite evident that just calling the file name returns the entire history to the screen.

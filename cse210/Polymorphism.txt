Polymorphism is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This means that a single interface can be used to represent different underlying data types, enabling flexibility and code reuse.

One key benefit of polymorphism is that it enhances code maintainability and scalability. By using polymorphism, we can write more generalized code that can work with different object types without modifying the core logic. This leads to cleaner, more modular code that is easier to extend and update.

A common application of polymorphism is method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. This allows different behaviors for the same method depending on the object that is calling it.

Reading Lehi's dream again, I noticed that he knew he was in a dream and didn't want to wake up. He didn't look back, but rather looked around.
I must not look to the past because after reaching the tree of life, the past no longer matters, that is, the wrong things that may have been done.
I teach every two Sundays, I am adding some topics from the Book of Mormon in classes and this study has helped me a lot.
The Lord is by my side, he will heal my wounds, he will help me open my mind to more revelations, he will give me more purposes and guidance.

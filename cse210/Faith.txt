This week I learned that faith has different levels. For example, the faith that I have, my wife has more. This is because the actions of some people are different from those of others. In the book of Mormon these different levels are mentioned, there are records of people with extraordinary faith and other people with great faith, there is also unshakable faith and perfect faith.

What I know about the spiritual world, resurrection and judgment is that in the spiritual world it will be the continuation of the life we ​​have here, that is, we will continue with our thoughts, our actions, we will feel happiness and sadness. Of course, because it is a different world, everything will not be exactly the same as it was here on Earth. Resurrection can come at any time for people, I know that many have already been resurrected together with Christ and after him as well. The judgment will be after the millennium, yesterday we will have a thousand years without the enemy's strength having power over people.

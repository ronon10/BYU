Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, it is basically hiding the details of the code so as not to make a bad interaction with the end user and showing only what is necessary for the user.
A very good benefit is security, it protects the internal code when hiding. Also, clean code allows changes to internal details without affecting other parts of the code.
An example of encapsulation application is in bank account management, where the balance is protected and the person can only withdraw what is in the balance without taking out more.
